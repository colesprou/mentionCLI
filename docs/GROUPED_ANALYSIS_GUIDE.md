# Kalshi Mention Markets - Grouped Analysis Guide

## Overview

The Kalshi Mention Markets research tool now groups markets by their title/topic, allowing you to run data pipelines and AI analysis on related markets as a group rather than individually.

## Key Features

### âœ… **Smart Grouping**
- Markets are automatically grouped by their title (e.g., "What will Apple say during earnings?")
- Each group contains all related markets for that specific topic
- Shows market count, tickers, status, bid/ask prices, and volume

### âœ… **Data Pipeline Commands**
After running `markets` or `mentions`, you can use:

- `analyze <group_number>` - Run AI analysis on a market group
- `research <group_number>` - Run research pipeline on a market group  
- `summary <group_number>` - Generate AI summary for a market group

### âœ… **Accurate Filtering**
- Only shows markets that are currently open/active
- Filters by close date (today or later)
- Ensures markets have actual bid/ask prices (tradeable)

## Usage Examples

### 1. Interactive Mode
```bash
source venv/bin/activate && python main.py
```

Then use commands:
```
[kalshi-research] markets
[kalshi-research] analyze 1
[kalshi-research] research 2
[kalshi-research] summary 3
```

### 2. Demo Script
```bash
source venv/bin/activate && python demo_grouped_analysis.py
```

### 3. Direct Testing
```bash
source venv/bin/activate && python test_cli.py
```

- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API errors and invalid inputs

## Next Steps

1. **Run the interactive CLI**: `python main.py`
2. **View grouped markets**: Use `markets` command
3. **Analyze specific groups**: Use `analyze 1`, `research 2`, etc.
4. **Extend data pipelines**: Add more sophisticated analysis features
