# Kalshi Mention Markets - Event-Based Analysis Guide

## Overview

The Kalshi Mention Markets research tool now correctly groups markets by **event** (e.g., "What will Apple say during earnings?") and shows the individual **bet words** (e.g., "AI", "revenue", "shutdown") as separate markets within each event group.

## Key Structure

### âœ… **Event-Based Grouping**
- **Event**: The main question/topic (e.g., "What will Apple say during earnings?")
- **Bet Markets**: Individual markets for different words/phrases that might be mentioned
- **Bet Words**: The actual words being bet on (extracted from ticker symbols)

### âœ… **Example Structure**
```
Event: "What will Apple say during earnings?"
â”œâ”€â”€ Bet: "AI" (Bid/Ask: 45/55, Vol: $1,200)
â”œâ”€â”€ Bet: "revenue" (Bid/Ask: 30/40, Vol: $800)
â”œâ”€â”€ Bet: "shutdown" (Bid/Ask: 15/25, Vol: $500)
â””â”€â”€ ... 10 more bet options
