# Event-Specific Data Pipelines Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive event-specific data pipelines for different types of mention markets, with full bet word extraction and specialized research strategies.

## ✅ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Event Type Detection System**
- **Earnings**: Detects "earnings" or "earnings call" in event titles

- **Entertainment**: Detects entertainment keywords like "oscars", "awards", "show", "concert", etc.
- **General**: Fallback for unknown event types

### 2. **Full Bet Word Extraction**
- **Fixed**: Now shows complete bet words instead of shortened versions
- **Priority**: Uses subtitle first, then title, then ticker as fallback
- **Example**: "Will Apple mention 'AI' during earnings?" instead of just "AI"
