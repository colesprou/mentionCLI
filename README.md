## 🎯 Trading Strategy

### Finding Edge

1. **High hit rate, low market probability** → Buy YES
2. **Low hit rate, high market probability** → Buy NO
3. **Equal probabilities** → Pass (no edge)

### Example Analysis

```
Term: "protein cold foam"
Historical Hit Rate: 81.8%
Market Price (YES): 45 cents
Edge: 81.8% - 45% = 36.8% positive edge

✅ Recommended: BUY YES at 45 cents
```
